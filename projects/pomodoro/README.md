## A Python Tkinter GUI for the Pomodoro technique.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980's. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by a short break.

#### We will use the following requirements:

TIMER RESET
- Logic to reset the application.

TIMER MECHANISM 
- Logic to start the application 

COUNTDOWN MECHANISM 
- Logic to have 4 intervals of given timestamp.
- Logic to display a notification to take a short break after every interval
- Logic to display a notification to take a longer break after 4 intervals.
  
UI SETUP 
- Use the Tkinter grid layout manager to place the labels (timer and checkmark).
- Add the buttons (start and reset).
